<h1><a id="Introduction"></a>External Data Sources - OverLOD Referencer<a class="section_anchor" href="#Introduction"></a></h1>

<p>
    External Data Sources aims at managing data coming from external sources, as RDF files, RDFa, data from a SPARQL end-point or even non-RDF structured data that needs to be translated to RDF as for instance Microdata from schema.org.
		External Data Source is abbreviated EDS in the different interfaces and messages.
		<br>
		Currently this is only a demonstrator that handles RDF files. 
<p>
		To manage the update of such external data sources effectively, each source must correspond to a specific graph (context) in Marmotta.
<p>
		This module is developped by the HES-SO as part of the OverLOD project.
