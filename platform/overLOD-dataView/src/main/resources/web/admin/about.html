<h1><a id="Introduction"></a>Data View - OverLOD<a class="section_anchor" href="#Introduction"></a></h1>

<p>
    Data Views are predefined queries (SPARQL), designed by administrators, that will allow developers to request data in common formats (JSON, CSV, etc.) without the need to understand the underlying RDF format and ontologies.
<p>
		This module is developped by the HES-SO Valais-Wallis, <a href="http://www.hevs.ch/fr/rad-instituts/institut-informatique-de-gestion/">Institut Informatique de Gestion</a> in Switzerland, as part of the OverLOD project.
